This is the grading rubric for the Housing programming assignment.

================
If the program fails to compile, crashes, or hangs then the program
automatically gets a 0.
================

Functionality	     5
 - output for medium.txt matches medium.txt.out 100% except for the statistics
 section.
 - performance will be graded based by running the program on huge.txt then
   points assigned based on runtime. The program has to produce correct output
   as well.
      < 1.5 seconds	5 points
      < 3 seconds	4 points
      < 6 seconds	3 points
      < 10 seconds	2 points
      < 15 seconds	1 point
      > 15 seconds	0 points

Implementation	    10
 - the hashtable uses a linkedlist to handle collisions
 - has a copy constructor, assignment operator, and destructor for all classes
   that have pointer data members.
 - no memory leaks or memory errors
 - the hashtable uses a dynamically allocated array for storage with 9973 rows
 - string data is represented using char* (or char[])
 - personnel.cpp is unchanged
 - performance will be graded based by running the program on huge.txt then
   points assigned based on runtime:
      less than 1.5 seconds 

Design		     3
 - uses at least the following classes: person, hashtable, and personmgr
 - the personmgr class doesn't contain any implementation of the hashtable
 - the hashtable class doesn't do any output

Style		     2
 - each class is defined in a separate file
 - class definition and implementation are in separate files (unless a template)
 - at most 1 return statement per function or method
 - doesn't use of "break" or "continue" in a loop

Total:		    20
